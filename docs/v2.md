# Secrets using SecretGenerator in Kustomize.

```shell
kubectl apply -k .\examples\v2
```

After the deployment was finished, I used my browser to navigate to `awx-demo.example.com`. The site was up and I was able to login using the username and password specified in the awx spec. This confirmed the deployment was successful, and that it utilized the secrets I specified using SecretGenerator in Kustomize.
